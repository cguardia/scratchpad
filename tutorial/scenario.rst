Scenario
========

Pyramid excels at building web applications in several fashions. Like
Pylons before it, Pyramid can build traditional routes-oriented RDBMS
applications using SQLAlchemy. Pyramid can also though build
content-oriented applications familiar from the world of Zope and Plone.

Since this is a tutorial for the Plone Conference,
we are choosing a scenario that plays to Pyramid's strengths in
content-style applications. Namely, a hierarchical project management
system where you can assign tasks to teams.
